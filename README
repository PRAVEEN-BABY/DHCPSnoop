DHCPSnoop
=======
DHCPSnoop will listen on the network for DHCP responses and verify that the parameters returned are correct.

This helps out in a dev environment where developers and QA staff will accidently turn on a DHCP server :)

Installation
============
To install:

    python setup.py build
    sudo python setup.py install
